After a long pause, I realized the importance of writing regularly to express my ideas.
The objective is to support my research and personal studies through regular posts.

I also recovered old posts from the years 2013 to 2015 on entrepreneurship and on managing data science teams.

I hope these and future posts are valuable for anyone looking at strengthening their enterprise machine learning capabilities.

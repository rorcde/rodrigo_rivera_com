    caption: Machine Learning Summer Schools for the Emerging World
---

Rodrigo is very enthusiastic about engaging with the international machine-learning community. He combines his passions for entrepreneurship and teaching in educational events for research enthusiasts and practitioners.

## The School of Machine Learning at Skoltech

In 2020, we started SMILES, the Summer School of Machine Learning at Skoltech. We aim to provide a venue for the nascent researcher in machine learning for the emerging world.

### In one sentence

The School of Machine Learning at Skoltech is the leading online summer school for the emerging world's machine learning researcher.

### What?

The School of Machine Learning at Skoltech (SMILES) is an online one-week intensive course about modern statistical machine learning methods. It aims at bringing together the Machine Learning community from the CIS, Central Asia, and the Caucasus regions. SMILES presents topics that are at the core of machine learning research, from fundamentals to the state-of-the-art.

### Why?

A successful machine learning researcher needs skills, network, and visibility. Most universities in the emerging world do not teach the forefront of machine learning. Only selected institutions in the US and the UK do it. Moreover, a nascent researcher needs peers to work on joint projects and get feedback on her work. SMILES provides three things, the latest knowledge in machine learning, access to a network of peers, and a venue to showcase research work.

### For whom?
Courses are accessible to anyone with mathematical maturity, from advanced bachelor students to seasoned professionals interested in transitioning to machine learning research.

### How?

SMILES is a fully online summer school.

### When?

SMILES takes place each summer in Mid-August for one week.

### What is the format?

SMILES consists of mini-courses of up to three hours covering contemporary topics of machine learning.

## Machine Learning Summer School

The Machine Learning Summer School stretches back to 2002 when two very distinguished scientists, B. Scholkopf and A. Smola, first created it. Since then, more than 36 schools have taken place in multiple countries.

Skoltech’s Machine Learning Summer School, taking place from August 26 to September 6, 2019, drew participants from 36 countries worldwide. Initially, our MLSS attracted 800+ applications from over 40 countries. Nearly half were Ph.D. students, 21% were from industry, 23% were MSc students, and 7% postdocs from academia.

We sold a total of 250 tickets, half the participants were Russian, and 8% of these are part of the Skoltech community. Members of industry represented 40% of the participants, most of whom work for companies in Russia. German participants made up 9% of attendees, Chinese made up 5.5%, representing the most prominent international contingents. Participants and speakers hailed from world-renowned institutions such as Stanford University, Cornell University, Carnegie Mellon, Oxford University, ETH Zurich, TU Munich, and others.

MLSS is a great opportunity to meet with specialists in various machine learning fields and network with fellow students from all corners of the globe.
